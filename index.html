		<h1>Be Vegan Motherfucker</h1>
		<h3>
			Just as you read it, be vegan motherfucker.
		</h3>
		<p>
			If you're not vegan you're a real motherfucker. What the hell are you thinking about that you're not vegan yet? 
		</p>
		<p>
			Thousands and thousands	of animals are being murdered and tortured by you motherfucker. Cows, pigs, chickens, fishâ€”they're all caught in a nightmare because a motherfucker pay for it.

	<h2>
		If you think veganism is a "diet"
	</h2>
	<h3>Please, please, please...</h3
	<p>
	Stop talking bullshit piece of shit. <strong>Veganism is respect</strong> motherfucker. Respect for animal life. Respect for those beings who feel and suffer as much as you could.
	</p>
	<p>
	 I don't give a fuck how you feed yourself or what shit you put in your fucking mouth. The only thing that matters is the fucking respect for other animals.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Animals are NOT fucking objects
	</h2>
	<p>
		Each animal wants to live their own fucking life. They want to have their own fucking family and walk free on the fucking Earth. 
	</p>
	<h3>"Why bother? They're just animals!"</h3>
	<p>
		You are so fucking asshole. Put your fucking ass in the animal position and ask yourself if you would like the same fucking thing for you?
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Would you like to live in prison room all your fucking life?</li>
		<li>Would you like to be castrated without any fucking injection?</li>
		<li>Would you like to dead in a gas chamber like a fucking jew?</li>
		<li>Maybe you like having a knife in your fucking neck and bleeding to fucking death</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>If you "love" cats and dogs</h2>
	<p>"Oh how cute they are"</p>
	<p>
		Shut the fuck up motherfucker... What about the pigs, what about the cows? Do you think they don't suffer pain like other animals? Don't be a hypocrite. You have never "loved" animals, you're a fucking speciesist (google it motherfucker)
	</p>
	<h2>
		They are living in the fucking hell motherfucker
	</h2>
	<p>
		Don't you realize it yet? You're supporting the slavery of animals and you keep it going as if nothing is happening, you're takin a shit.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are living in the age of internet and you stil think we need animals to live. Really?
	</p>
	<h2>
		It's the fucking 21st century
	</h2>
	<p>
		I mean motherfucker, put your fucking ass to google and start searching.
	</p>
	<p>
		You have supermarkets in every fucking part of the world. All of them with all the fucking nutrients you need. Any of your shitty excuses are bullshits.
	</p>
	<h2>You don't need animals at all</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Entertainment? <del>Animals</del> -> Netflix</li>
		<li>Clothes? <del>Animals</del> -> Cotton</li>
		<li>Food? <del>Animals</del> -> Beans and vegetables</li>
		<li>Experiments? <del>Animals</del> -> Your fucking ass</li>
		<li>Transport? <del>Animals</del> -> Bike? Scooter? Your fucking feet?</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		THIS IS AN INJUSTICE
	</h2>
	<p>
		You demand them, you kill them. As long as you become vegan, animals will continue to be abused, tortured and murdered by you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stop supporting this shit motherfucker.
